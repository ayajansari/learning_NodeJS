****middleware (body-parser) 
->body-parser is a middleware in Node.js that is used to 
parse the incoming request bodies in a middleware before 
your handlers, making it easier to access the data. 
It parses the body of incoming requests (e.g., form data or JSON) 
and makes it available under the req.body property.

->req may contains different forms of data so body-parser will take 
that data and parse it in req.body so that we can directly use it.

*** express router
->server.js file contains many endpoints so it is bad practice to have 
all apis in server.js file ,to overcome this we can use express router.

->Express.Router is essentially a way to organize and manage routes in 
an Express application. When building a web server or API with Express, 
you typically have multiple routes (e.g., /home, /about, /users, etc.) 
that handle different parts of your application. As your application grows, 
managing all these routes in a single file can become unwieldy and hard to maintain.

->passport.js
in this we create middleware function which uses local strategy of passport.js
( i.e. takes username and password and do validation).
